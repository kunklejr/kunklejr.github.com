<p>Quick quiz, what is the output from the following JUnit test?</p>

``` java
package com.nearinfinity.sandbox;
import junit.framework.TestCase;

import org.junit.After;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;

public class ModelTest extends TestCase {

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        System.out.println("Setup called.");
    }

    @After
    public void teardown() {
        System.out.println("Teardown called.");
    }
 
    @Test
    public void testSomething() {
        assertTrue(true);
    }
 
}
```

<p>If you said</p>

``` java
Setup has been called.
Teardown has been called.
```

<p>you'd be wrong. Don't feel bad though, I spent about two hours staring at a similar test until I finally figured out what was going on. So, what's the problem?</p>

<p>The problem lies in the mixed use of JUnit 3 and 4 concepts. The astute reader will notice that this test extends the JUnit 3 <em>junit.framework.TestCase</em> while also using JUnit 4 annotations. So which wins, the base class methods, the annotations, or both? Well, it turns out that the JUnit 3 base class conventions win out and the annotations are ignored. With that said, can you now guess what the test output is? Did you guess</p>

``` console
Setup has been called.
```

<p>If not, don't feel bad. It's not immediately obvious. It turns out that the <em>testSomething</em> test method runs because it starts with the word <em>test</em>, not because it's decorated with the <em>org.junit.Test</em> annotation. The <em>setUp</em> method runs because it overrides <em>junit.framework.TestCase</em>'s <em>setUp</em> method, not because it has a <em>org.junit.Before</em> annotation. Lastly, the <em>teardown</em> method doesn't run at all because it does not override the base class <em>tearDown</em> method due to the lowercase "d" and as we've seen, the <em>org.junit.After</em> annotation has no effect.</p>

<p>That lower case "d" cost me two hours of my life, which I now consider time well spent. It made me realize that my test's inheritance chain ultimately led to <em>junit.framework.TestCase</em>. The fact that the test had worked in the past was a textbook case of dumb luck.</p>

<p>So, if your JUnit 4 test classes start acting strange, make sure that base class you're extending doesn't ultimately lead to a <em>junit.framework.TestCase</em>. </p>
