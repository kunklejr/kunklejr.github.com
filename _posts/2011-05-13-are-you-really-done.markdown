People often have a hard time determining if they're done with a
software development task. It's a great idea to sit down with your team
and together decide what you're going to consider as criteria for
declaring a task done. If you haven't done that yet, here's one
question you can ask yourself to help decide if you're done.

If you didn't quite implement all the unit tests you think you should
have, the answer is yes and **you're not done**. If you cut a corner or
two to squeeze it in before the end of the iteration, the answer is yes
and **you're not done**. If you're uncomfortable with the implementation
and would like to refactor it, the answer is yes and **you're not done**.
If there are a few details on the UI you left out in the interest of
time, the answer is yes and **you're not done**.

Too many times I've seen people close out a task only to revisit it the
next week to polish up some loose ends, write a few more tests,
refactor a confusing piece, etc. Don't do it.

Software development is hard enough without having to keep mental notes of
all the needed tweaks and adjustments to things you've already _done_.
Your goal should be to knock out a task so totally and completely that
you can get it out of your brain and focus on the next one. Doing so
will do wonders for your sense of accomplishment.
