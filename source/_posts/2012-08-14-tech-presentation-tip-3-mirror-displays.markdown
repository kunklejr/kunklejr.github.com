This is the third in a series of posts extracted from my [Presentation Tips Video](http://www.nearinfinity.com/techtalks/jeff_kunkle/2011/08/15/Presentation_Tips.html) from last year. You can [jump directly to this tip in the video](http://youtu.be/8l6dmfXovto?t=5m54s) if you'd rather watch it than read it.

Most of the presentations I give, and receive, involve software
development. More often than not this involves some amount of live
coding by the presenter. As most developers seem to using Macs these
days they're often using Keynote for any slides in their talk.

Keynote has a really handy presenters view that will show the
current slide, next slide, and timing information on your laptop display
while showing the presentation on the secondary display/projector.

Unfortunately, presenter view and live coding don't work well together.
If you're using presenter view then your laptop and projector are
showing different images. If you want your audience to see your live
coding you need to place your editor on the secondary display/projector.
This means that while you're typing you need to be looking at the
projector's display, not the one in front of you. I've never seen this
work out well.

No matter how easy you think it might be, typing while
straining to look over your shoulder is distracting. It's bound to be a
comedy of typing errors and comments about how hard it is to type on
your laptop while looking over your shoulder. So just don't do it. If
you plan to do any typing during your presentation then ditch
the presenter view and mirror your screens. It'll save you some stress
and keep your audience from losing interest in the guy who can't type.
