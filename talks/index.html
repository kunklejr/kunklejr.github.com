    Rising from non-existence three short years ago, Node.js is
    already attracting the accolades and disdain enjoyed and endured by
    the Ruby and Rails community just a short time ago. It overtook
    Rails as the most popular Github repository November 2011 and was
    selected by InfoWorld for the Technology of the Year Award in 2012.
    This presentation explains the basic theory and programming model
    central to Node's approach and will help you understand the
    resulting benefits and challenges it presents.

    some of the technical aspects surrounding your presentation, such as
    making sure you have the right adapter for your projector, preparing for
    screen-resolution shock, minimizing your external distractions, and
    sixteen more. These tips are easy to implement and will give your
    presentations an instant boost in effectiveness and professionalism.

    With all the tools available today for publishing a website or
    blog,it's easy to discount the traditional static website. However,
    you should think twice before drawing that conclusion. Static
    websites are super-fast, easy to implement, and can be hosted with
    almost any provider. This short presentation touches on static
    website generation using nanoc, a static website generation tool
    written in Ruby. While you won't be a nanoc expert after watching
    the video, it should give you an idea of how easy it is to quickly
    get up and running with astatic site.
